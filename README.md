# tai
T ictactoe A I - detective work for python beginners

## About

This is an open ended programming project for beginners. Its aims are to:

* Increase familiarity with the command line.
* Demystify the basic ideas behind AI.
* Demonstrate and encourage the use of documentation.

tai can work especially well as a follow up assignment to this in class activity: [Winning games: the
perfect tic-tac-toe player](http://www.cs4fn.org/teachers/activities/winatoxo/winatoxo.pdf).

## Requisite Python Concepts

* booleans
* variables
* lists
* loops
* functions

## Setup for the classroom

tai functions best as an assignment where students do not have direct access to the source code in the `/tai` directory. I recommend compiling those files:

``` python -m compileall tai ```

Provide students with the compiled files along with the `lab3.py` file. All instructions are located in this file. It is especially important that students do not access the `ai.py` file as this file contains potential AI solutions.

## Setup for an individual

**Don't open the `/tai` directory untill you have completed your own code!** Follow the instructions in the comments of `lab3.py`.
